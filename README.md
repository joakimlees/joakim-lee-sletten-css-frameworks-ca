# joakim-lee-sletten-css-frameworks-ca

This is my course assignment for css-frameworks at noroff

The course covers:

- Bootstrap
- Sass

### Task

Make a Social Media app with login, home and profile page.

### Reflections

I see how using a framework like bootstrap boosts productivity and how useful it is. With that said.
Familiarizing myself with bootstrap have been the struggle. Guess using it effectively with get better and better over time.

I still struggle to see when it's an good idea to write custom scss styles, and it can be a bit confusing to know whether or not to look for variables to change or to make custom styles is the solution. But i guess that will get better over time as well.

My focus for this project has been on familiarizing myself with bootstrap, and not so much on the visuals or actual design.

Things are making more and more sense, but a lot of it is still a bit of a mace, but I feel like I know whee and how to look for solutions, and thats probably the most important thing.
